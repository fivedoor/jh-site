        <p class="intro">Following on from the previous post - a look back to
        W3C web standards and some considerations that follow in the landscape
        of email&hellip;</p>

        <h2>Device Advantages &amp; Device Limitations</h2>

        <blockquote>
            "It is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience
            as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access
            from any particular class of device, except where this is necessary
            because of device limitations."<cite>W3 Web Standards</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Media Query Support</h3>

        <p>Obviously media queries would primarily be considered an advantage
        to help exploit mobile experience and offset limitations of screen area- but what kind of mail app is being used? Does it even support
      a responsive approach?</p>

        <p>We might have an instance where stats indicated a high proportion of
        android users vs iphone, with likely a high proportion of those
        accessing the gmail app. Suddenly the 50% of opens we envision our
        content enhancements to be affecting becomes a much smaller proportion.
        As it is, consideration should always be given to any significant
        increase in download weight but all the more if it's 'dead weight' to
        many users. It doesn't have to be 'either or' in terms of scalability
        and responsive approaches.</p>

        <p>A limitation could also arise in the form of flakey css support on a
        particular platform e.g. <a target="_blank" href=
        "https://stylecampaign.com/blog/2012/09/">Android Gingerbread's failure
        to display background images</a>. Definitely worth monitoring <a target="_blank" href=
        "https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">Android's
        developer blog</a> for stats on Gingerbread usage but until it's
        significantly lower I'd be cautious of employing them.</p>

        <h3>Location Location Low-Signal</h3>

        <p>Limitations can be assessed in context of the user scenario. Are
        they likely to be on public or home wifi, cellular 3G or 4G, dial-up,
        DSL/Cable modem or T1 line. The same content could take anything from a
        split second to half a minute to download.</p>

        <p>There may be parameters that cannot be controlled like the effects
        of dreaded proxy server compression on images. It may be worth
        considering how a users expectation changes in different viewing
        environments or devices. A positive or negative experience is always in
        context to whatever is regarded as the 'acceptable norm'. If something
        does have to degrade in the chain it should ideally do so where there's
        already an expectation of diminished experience.</p>

        <h3>Devices and Desires</h3>

        <p>The success of video and animated gif in driving engagement shows
        even approaches with very inconsistent support can be worth their many
        caveats. In that way best practice can be used as a tool to gain more
        understanding and control over an email's deviating path between
        graceful degradation and progressive enhancement.</p>

        <h3>Balance Scale</h3>

        <p>We can even consider 'device limitations' from an internal perspective
        too. In terms of the facility to test on a breadth of devices, device
        labs and/or <a target="_blank" href="https://litmus.com/email-testing"> Litmus testing</a>. When fueling engagement it can often pay
        to be adventurous and push the boundaries but that may demand a certain level of
        resources to meet the aims and be most effective.</p>

        <h3>High Res Devices</h3>

        <blockquote>
            "Different screen sizes may demand different sized images. It is
            very common when delivering content to mobile devices to vary the
            details of the markup, format of images, image sizes, colour depths
            to suit the characteristics of the device in question." <cite>W3
            Web Standards</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Another advantage that exists which can become a deficit in
        practice. More on the pros and cons of these in this <a  href="../retina-resolutions/index.html">this
        article</a>.</p>

        <p>Responsive design in theory promises a wider reaching and superior
        experience for mobile users but in practice things may not be clear
        cut. If your 300 pixel wide image asset, particularly one with any kind
        of typography, stretches to fit one of the mid to larger retina screens
        - results may not always compare favourably to an adaptive or
        scalable solution. Since layout and content changes will be effected
        client side and without javascript to call on we can't just mimic the
        kind of approaches that may exists for our web assets.</p>

        <h3>Might Give it a go in fuchsia</h3>

        <p>Crowbarring in a little code tip, it's common practice to use
        attribute selectors to prevent your mobile layout rendering in unwanted
        places like yahoo mail.</p>
        <pre>
<code class="language-css">td[class=italic]  { font-style:italic !important;}
td[class=fuchsia] { color:fuchsia !important;}</code>
</pre>

        <p>However this format seems to prevent the possibility of combining
        classes for an element which can be a bit annoying.</p>

        <p><a target="_blank" href=
        "https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/details/C13/stop_yahoo_mail_from_rendering_your_media_queries">
        EOA highlighted an alternative method used to give access to additional
        selector types</a> and this format will also allow for classes to be
        used in combination:</p>
        <pre>
<code class=
"language-css">body[yahoo] td.italic  { font-style:italic !important;}
body[yahoo] td.fuchsia { color:fuchsia !important;}</code>
</pre>

        <p>So using the above format the two classes could now be combined in
        the usual way to apply the styles of italic and fuchsia&hellip;</p>
        <pre>
<code class=
"language-markup"> &lt;td class=&quot;fuchsia italic&quot; style=&quot;font-family:Arial, serif; color:black; font-size:22px&quot;&gt;&quot;Fuchsia et Italica est meretricious at best&lt;/td&gt;</code>
</pre>

        <p>A bit more semantics to the CSS but the option means you're less
        likely to end up with a lot of similar classes with multiple repeated
      attributes. It's also a useful way of preventing AOL reading your media queries in chrome.</p>

        <h2>Navigation and links</h2>

        <blockquote>
            "Because of the limitations in display and of input mechanisms, the
            possible absence of a pointing device and other constraints of
            mobile devices, care should be exercised in defining the structure
            and the navigation model of a Web site." <cite>W3 Web
            Standards</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Design For Touch</h3>

        <p>Increase point size of navigation text so more touch friendly</p>

        <h3>Alternate mobile nav</h3>

        <p>Reduce or reformat or even serve a separate nav tailored to mobile
        users. Consideration can also be applied to where the navigation appears for mobile in terms of the desired hierarchy presented to the user.</p>

        <p>It may seem pointless to adjust your desktop/full width layout for
        mobile when you have media queries at your disposal but good scalable
        features are still valid for mail apps without media query support.</p>

        <h2>Adaptation</h2>

        <blockquote>
            "The process of altering content to enhance the user experience on
            particular devices is referred to as Content Adaptation." <cite>W3
            Web Standards</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>So the overarching ethos is adaptation and there are a range of
        approaches at our disposal for this which are pretty well
        documented:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Media Queries</li>

            <li>Fluid, Adaptive and Responsive Layouts</li>

            <li>Scalable Designs</li>

            <li>Server side solution like <a target="_blank" href="https://stylecampaign.com/blog/2011/02/dis-tech/">Style Campaign's DIS</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>One thing to emphasise might be to choose an approach that fits the
        aims and resource. That might not be the same for every campaign.
        Simple scalable solutions for one campaign, something responsive or
        adaptive for another.</p>

        <p>The take away being - be adaptable in your approach to
        adaptation.</p>
