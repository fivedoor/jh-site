    <article class="group main">
      
        <p class="intro">I was asked by a client recently "What is best
      practice for an email on mobile?" While many ESPs offer practical guidelines, I wanted to take the opportunity to refer back to web standards for a refresher and some context. </p>

        <p class="first">It's a subtle distinction but the idea being to start
        from the perspective of fundamental principals that seek to improve experience, rather than just  reeling off the
        latest approaches and aphorisms doing the rounds, and  to an extent working
        backwards.</p>
        
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.email-standards.org/">The Email Standards Project </a>was launched on 2007, though I haven't registered much activity of late. Possibly following the launch of Outlook 2013 there was mass seppuku by all involved.</p>

        <h3>Official Standards&nbsp;</h3>

        <p>Reference to email standards on W3C reads more as a plea for action
        for email-client developers to support web standards than a
        comprehensive guide</p>

        <p>To an extent mobile web standards can be extrapolated to the context
        of email. The main caveat being email clients don't support web
        standards so we're forced contextualise to the restrictions of clients,
        browsers and mail apps. In turn we can look at the subscriber base, user
        stats and target audience, and decide where the priorities for the
        campaign lie&#8230;</p>

        <p>For a business to be spurred into reflecting on these things is
        ultimately beneficial and likely to yield better results than  the
        mindset of just jumping on the must-have upgrade or feature du jour.</p>

        <p>Below are a few parameters plucked from the W3C web standards page
        and some considerations that follow on from them. A lot of the ideas
        overlap and some are already well covered so I've kept it brief in
      places</p>

        <h2>One Web</h2>

        <blockquote>
            One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information
            and services available to users irrespective of the device they are
            using. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information
            is available in exactly the same representation across all devices.
            <cite>W3 Web Standards</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>'One Web' is a phrase that gives off  a mawkish   cheesy wiff of coca cola style  sloganeering  but it's essentially just promoting the idea of enabling the best
      possible experience to everyone in a practical way.</p>

        <p>A few familiar design approaches that sit under the 'One Web'
        umbrella:</p>

        <ul class="list-headed">
            <li>Progressive Enhancement

                <p>Create for the lowest common denominator and spec i.e. the "Default
                Delivery Context". Enhance the experience to "Exploit Device
                Capabilities" where feasible.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Graceful DEGRADATION

                <p>Build for the highest spec/best case scenario, then add
                fixes to accommodate devices lower down the chain. Often
                an appropriate choice where an existing product or format needs to be
                maintained. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>What also follows is you need to be aware if the
        handlers or enhancements being implemented have adverse affects elsewhere
        in the chain e.g. Are your media queries written to prevent them
        rendering the mobile layout in some webmail clients.</p>

        <p>With email it's not always clear cut what the highest and lowest
        spec scenarios are. Desktop will have much greater screen real estate to play with while mobile
      will often offer much more css support.</p>

        <p>It can be helpful to establish some precedence in terms of
        connecting with and enhancing experience for core customers and their
        technology vs the compromises required to reach further and further
        outlier clients. Simple things like ranking email clients, devices,
        customer profiles, even user case scenarios in order of priority can
        help to inform the logistics of what is eventually built.</p>

        <h2>Bandwidth And Cost</h2>

        <blockquote>
            Extra material contributes to poor usability and may add
            considerably to the cost of the retrieval. <cite>W3 Web
            Standards</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p> Reducing content and file size with...</p>

        <h3>Image File Formats</h3>

        <p>Appropriate use of gif, jpg and even png. Also, the whys and
        wherefores of using @1.5 or @2x (high res) assets.</p>

        <h3>Image Compression</h3>

        <p>Beyond 'save for web' exploring avenues like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jpegmini.com/">				  		Jpeg Mini</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://imageoptim.com/">Image Optim</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/">RIOT</a>.
        Even high res images can be heavily compressed - but there are <a href="../retina-resolutions/index.html">pros and
        cons</a>.</p>

        <h3>Economical Html</h3>

        <p>There's generally more than one way to bake an email cake. e.g.
        Sometimes using multiple nested tables or rows for text blocks is the
        only way to get consistency for paragraphing and stylings but once in a
        while you can get away with employing <code class="language-markup">&lt;br/&gt;</code> and <code class="language-markup">&lt;span&gt;</code> tags
        to ditch a few kb.</p> 
        
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.textfixer.com/html/compress-html-compression.php">Code compressors </a>can be useful to crush down a few kb. Of course, if it's a template that will see regular
        use  it can be lean but a bit of readable 'paragraphing' and
        the occasional <code class="language-markup">&lt;!-- comment --&gt;</code> may be worth retaining.</p>

        <h3>Economical Content</h3>

        <p>Probably the most obvious and possibly  most ignored. Less is
        very often more, especially where screen real estate and attention span
        are at a premium. </p>
        
        <p>Cutting image download weight and improving accessibility where appropriate e.g. Ideally we're employing html text/system fonts for our body copy but even in cases where some text is rendered as image there's still scope to use html for certain visual elements and to create spacing and background colours - slicing headers and banners without masses of redundant white space.</p>
        <p>Most techniques employed to hide content from mobile
          viewers (the reliable ones so far as I can ascertain anyway) will not
          prevent that content from being downloaded so be prepared to consider
          compromises that cater for an expanding audience on handheld
          devices.</p>

        <p>Even if you're not reducing download weight by suppressing certain
        content where possible - there's still a value to streamlining the
        user's path...</p>

        <h2>User Goals</h2>

        <blockquote>
            Mobile users typically have different interests to users of fixed
            or desktop devices. Equally, mobile users are typically less
            interested in lengthy documents or in browsing&#8230; Some services
            and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular
            user contexts. <cite>W3 Web Standards</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Alternate content &amp; CTAs</h3>

        <p>Designing with scalability in mind or employing media queries to
        adapt the layout. Ideally a bit of both.</p>

        <p>Where there's media query support:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Low priority content can be hidden to streamline the
            experience</li>

            <li>Users can also be channeled to an alternate url with a bit of
            extra coding that doesn't rely on javascript.</li>

            <li>Linking to an app or app store could be appropriately targeted
            to the mobile user.</li>

            <li>Sometimes an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emaildesignreview.com/email-design-best-practice/how-should-we-design-html-emails-for-mobile-users-817/">"add to wishlist"</a> might be more appropriate than a
            "shop now" for mobile users. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We might automatically regard mobile as the lesser sibling of
        desktop but with the restrictions of desktop &amp; webmail defining the
        'Default Delivery Context' is not so straightforward&#8230;TBC</p>
