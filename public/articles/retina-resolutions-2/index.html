                    <p>A few tests; a few observations; and further thoughts on
                    things like compression, kilobytes and consistency &#8230;</p>
                </div>

        </article>

        <article class="group main">

            <p class="intro">The observations below were based on a comparison
            of <a href="retinatests.html">sample images</a> on various screens,
            and further tests done for a client using in-house image resource.
            It's far from a comprehensive survey but did make for some
            interesting observations&hellip;</p>

            <p>I included typography in the test images to assess scenarios where a palette of typography that goes beyond system
            fonts is a requirement.</p>

            <h2>Observations</h2>

            <h3>Image quality</h3>

            <ul class="list-default">
                <li>Heavy Compression Works

                    <p>@2x images at low percentage compression rates as low as
                    10% do surprisingly well across the board for desktop,
                    retina and non-retina displays.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Except ...

                    <p>If there are large areas of a flat tonal bg colour or
                    even texture (similar tones blending into one another) the
                    gradation can get quite pixely and blocky on @2x images
                    particularly beneath 30%</p>
                </li>

                <li>Text rendered as image requires less compression...

                    <p>Unsurprisingly there's a lot more scope for compressing
                     images that don't contain typography. In some cases there
                    may be a case for using hi-res gif for certain areas that
                    include text.</p>
                </li>

                <li>For best results on standard res mobile the image should be
                served at original or double size...

                    <p>To obtain sharp readable text the image is best served
                    at original size or @2x size. Scaling from other
                    over-sampled sizes gives less crisp, even blurry results for
                    text in particular.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Antialiasing settings may help

                    <p>Choice of antialiasing settings in photoshop is a factor
                    worth considering. I find sharp or crisp tend to give best
                    results for @2x images</p>
                </li>

                <li>On standard screens over-sampled images at varying sizes
                work reasonably well.

                    <p>On Desktop and webmail double size images and
                    over-sampled images at varying degrees all resized well. A
                    slight drop off in crispness of text was perceivable
                    compared to standard sizes.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Proxy Problems

                    <p>if viewed on cellular network proxy server compression
                    can mean the already highly compressed images look like
                    total junk. Though this isn't an issue limited to high res
                    assets. These inconsistencies are something I'm trying to
                    learn more about.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Overall results are pretty positive with the a few caveats
            mainly in regard to images that contain typography.</p>

            <h3>Image Size:</h3>

            <p>On the whole an @2x image will require an increase in the kb
            size but with heavy compression it doesn't have to be
            significant.</p>

            <p>I didn't quite experience the kind of positive results suggested
            by <a target="_blank" href=
            "https://www.netvlies.nl/blog/design-interactie/retina-revolution">Daan
            Jobsis's tests</a>. I see in subsequent comments it was suggested
            some flawed testing approaches had been used (not saving for web;
            control images not at full size in test) which might explain
            things.</p>

            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.jpegmini.com/">JPEG Mini</a> and <a target="_blank" href=
            "https://imageoptim.com/">Image Optim</a> don't cut much off the
            image size when they're already compressed for web.</p>

            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/">RIOT</a> may be another
            option I'm yet to explore. My only experience of it so far is the
            viruses the downloaded introduced to my girlfriends PC. At least,
            that's the story I'm sticking with :)</p>

            <p>Even if it becomes viable at some point in the future to create
            two sets of assets where we only serve the larger versions to
            retina devices - that will require some increase in production time
            which may not be practical.</p>

            <p>Perhaps these issues won't seem immediately pressing in the
            world of email (and depending on subscribers current devices of
            choice) but if we're heading to a place where a high proportion of
            devices eventually 'go retina' and we care about their experience
            then these are matters that ought to be considered.</p>

            <h3>3T</h3>

            <p>It's also about getting in the mindset of the
            technology/techniques/testing informing the campaign to get better
            results. For example if I know I can get a lot more milage out of
            compressing a very busy detailed image with multiple tones than
            one with flat tonal imagery that might inform the resource created for a
            campaign and how we set that up to create maximum inbox impact.</p>
