                <h1 ><span class="titles-large">High Resolution</span></h1>

                <p>With the growing presence of hi res screens I've been
                curious to explore any practical techniques or strategies for
                images &#8230;</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </article>

    <article class="group main">
        <p class="intro">High res devices are growing in popularity and number
        so I've been eager to explore any nifty techniques, or even a viable strategy for employing high res images to
        improve email experience across the board.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it's not surprising this is less of a topic haunting email
        since most designs still tend to stick with something scalable that
        effectively shrinks to fit the mobile screen.</p>

        <p>That said, if we're attempting to harness the power of responsive design to improve
        readability and click-ability then the manner in which hi-res screens
        effectively stretch the <em>density independent pixels</em> of an image
        to fit their more dense <em>device pixel</em> displays creates a frustrating drop off 			in image quality.

</p>

        <p>It's not just mobile. Looking at many emails on a hi res tablet the
        world can start to feel a bit soft focus. Results tend to be passable
        but where feasible, well tailored image resource might really help a
        campaign stand out.</p>

        <h2>High Res Images</h2>

        <p>The solution of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/20/towards-retina-web/">down-sampling a double size image</a>
        seems simple and comprehensible but there are a few issues it brings
        particularly in email where things are always a bit more
        restrictive.</p>

        <h3>Compression Techniques</h3>

        <p><a target="_blank" href=
        "http://benfrain.com/how-to-serve-high-resolution-website-images-for-retina-displays-new-ipadiphone4/">
        Ben Frain</a> and <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.netvlies.nl/blog/design-interactie/retina-revolution">Daan
        Jobsis </a>articles gave reason to be hopeful that this approach needn't
        result in a massive hike in file sizes.</p>

        <h3>Background Images</h3>

        <p>Using CSS background images to serve an alternate set of images for
        hi res devices is another approach to keep file sizes manageable.
        However, while <a target="_blank" href="http://stylecampaign.com/blog/2012/09/">CSS
        background images aren't reliably supported on Android Mail 2.3</a>.
        (Gingerbread being the major OS) then it doesn't feel very viable.
        Furthermore, desktop and laptops with retina display would still be
        stuck with the @1x assets on a 2x screen when accessing desktop and
        webmail.</p>

        <h3>Production Practicalities</h3>

        <p>There's also the issue of additional production time required to
        create two sets of assets.</p>

        <p>The 1:1 device pixel to dip (density independent pixel) ratio that
        has existed from device to device up until recent times makes the
        process of applying image compression during production pretty
        straightforward. What you see is more or less what you get across the
        board.</p>

        <p>Applying compression whilst viewing on a screen with
        device-pixel-ratio of 1, doesn't give much indication of how it will
        render on a mobile or tablet device with a different dpr.</p>

        <p>I've generally found 60 to be a reliable starting point for
        compression when saving images for web. If there was a similar go-to
        starting point for hi res that might be helpful.</p>

        <h2>Some Key Questions for employing high res images:</h2>

        <ul class="list-summary">
            <li>Can a 'one image fits all' solution be viable?</li>

            <li>How much can we compress a @2x image before a drop in quality
            is significantly perceivable ?</li>

            <li>How much will a compressed @2x img increase email weight?</li>

            <li>How will a @2x image look when rendered on a @1x screen.</li>

            <li>How will adoption of high res images affect production
            process?</li>
